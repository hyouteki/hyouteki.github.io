Repository for exploring cryptographic algorithms/techniques and their applications in regards to security of network. This includes from scratch implementations of:

1. [Transposition cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher) in C and [FASM](https://flatassembler.net/)
2. [AES128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) in Python
3. [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) in C using <gnu/gmp.h>
4. Public Key Distribution Authority ([PKDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)) in C using RSA
5. GNU/GMP’s [mpz t](https://gmplib.org/manual/Initializing-Integers) in C and C++
6. [Diffie-hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) in C++
