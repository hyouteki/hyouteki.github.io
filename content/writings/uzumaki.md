The horror till now is not extramundane except for the paranormal obsession over the spiral, but this cannot be extrapolated to what is at the doorstep. The weird obsession of Shuichi’s father was the very cause of his death (the first knock); his spiraled corpse so immaculately rested inside a wooden container."

## Horror
From obsessing over spiraled items to finding new solitude in bodily spirals; the horror of revolving eyes, rolled-up tongue, long but still nothing compared to the horror which was about to knock. The horror till now was not extramundane except for the paranormal obsession over the spiral, but this cannot be extrapolated to what was at the doorstep. The weird obsession of Shuichi’s father was the very cause of his death (<u>the first knock</u>); his spiraled corpse so immaculately rested inside a wooden container. The ash(ed) smoke rised in the air and formed a dark spiral coming out of undoubtedly Shuichi’s father (the never-ending obsession with spirals; continuing after the death). Forever etching our brain tablet with these dark verses (the spiraled sky remains till the end of the story). Watching over us from afar and moving us as puppets. In the end, the smoke swirled down in the pond; mixing and affecting the very necessity "Water".

The fear of spirals was imprinted in Shuichi’s mother. “Sanity”, she can’t keep around with anything even slightly resembling a spiral. Seeing her hair tied up in a spiraled bun; she shaved, spirals in fingerprints; she tore down her fingerprints with scissors. The fear took all the bodily spirals from her, visible on the surface. The city alarm which rangs every day at 5 PM; a sharp creaking song piercing through her ears. The fear got the better of her, sparking the existence of spirals inside the human ear; might be her forgotten memory or her excuse for not wanting to hear that crooked dirge of an alarm. The horror (death) drawing near. Fear possessed her, cutting down her ears; death came (<u>the second knock</u>); hunted by the spirals until the end of her being. Death was not a slow one; the act of slowly making us walk through those gruesome acts of ravaging her own body and dying in a poor attempt of saving herself from those satanic swirls of a shape; not being able to forget the gore she witnessed. The exact words “Come join me in the spiral” is the horror. On the day of her funeral, another spiraled fume appeared over the town. Spirals come and go; disintegrate you into a spiral (just like cancer cells making normal cells undergo mutation and turn into one of them; and killing us in the end).
